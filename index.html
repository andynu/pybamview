<p>Browser based application for viewing bam alignments</p>
<p>This repository is under construction! And all of this has <strong>only been tested on Google chrome</strong></p>
PyBamView is a python based application that allows you to view BAM DNA sequence alignments through your web browser. It was inspired by the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml">samtools tview</a> tool, and was motivated by the need to better visualize alignments with complex insertions/deletions across multiple samples, which is not handled well by current broswers such as IGV and the UCSC Genome Browser.

PyBamView is run locally, without the need to upload large alignment/genome files to external sites, and provides text-based alignments that are fast and easy to navigate. Take a look at the <a href="example.html">example</a> to learn more.
